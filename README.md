# HE-VPR

This part of code can be used for the HE-Adapter evaluation and VPR-Adapter evaluation.
Most of the testing code can be refered in ```test_HE.py``` and ```test_VPR.py```.

Notably, we divide the dataset into four parts as shown in ```get_HEVPR_test_datasets.py```.

The dataset and pretrained weight will be released after the review stage is complete.
